# iOS

- Current status: falls back to the built-in JS fetch path. Cronet integration is planned.
- `nitroFetchOnWorklet` runs the mapper on the JS thread on iOS.
- The public JS API remains the same across platforms, so you can start integrating `react-native-nitro-fetch` now and benefit from Cronet on Android.

See also: `docs/cronet-ios.md` for high-level Cronet iOS integration notes.
